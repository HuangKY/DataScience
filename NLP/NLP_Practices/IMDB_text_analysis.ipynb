       "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""

    "\"CHALLENGING GENDER DISCRIMINATION: A HOW-TO GUIDE We are all influenced by gender. Gender norms (or rules) tell us what is appropriate for girls and for boys, women and men to do in our society. Because of gender stereotypes, girls and women are often less valued and have lower social status. Sophie (front) is a gender equality and sexual health campaigner from Uganda.

There is lots we can do to help build a more gender-equal world. Understanding the deep roots of gender inequality and challenging discrimination when we see it are the first steps.WHAT IS GENDER DISCRIMINATION? Gender discrimination describes the situation in which people are treated differently simply because they are male or female, rather than on the basis of their individual skills or capabilities. The following is a list of discriminatory acts you may come across among your peers, at home, at school or in the workplace. Sexual harassment, catcalling Harassment and catcalling on the street are prime examples of how women’s right to walk freely around their environment is restricted. The normalisation of harassment and inaction of bystanders and authorities perpetuate this form of discrimination and limit women’s freedom. The Girls Get Equal campaign is taking off in India. Girls are advocating for gender equality from Canada to India. We're supporting them. Gender stereotypes at school and work Stereotypes are how societies expect people to act based on their gender. For example, girls should stay at home and help with housework and childcare, should dress modestly and not stay out late at night. People are often judged by how well they adhere to the gender stereotypes. These stereotypes can often bleed out into school and work, where girls are less likely to be encouraged into science and technology subjects or leadership roles, due to the perceived ‘male nature’ of these pursuits. Likewise, seemingly positive stereotypes and gender roles such as men being the ‘provider’ or ‘protector’ of the family, put an unnecessary burden on men and boys that could more positively be shared in an equal partnership. These attitudes limit girls’ power by rendering them less able to help contribute to making the world around them a better place. Objectification and poor representation Objectification is when a person is treated as a commodity or an object without regard to their personality or dignity. It commonly happens in the media where women are photoshopped and airbrushed leading to much more emphasis and value being put on their external appearance above other capacities. This affects girls’ body image, their self-esteem and ultimately the value they put on themselves. However, girls are also often represented poorly in entertainment and the media in ways that reinforce damaging gender stereotypes and traditional roles. Objectication must be called out and girls must be encouraged to tell their own stories - ones that reflect their power, potential and diversity. TAKE THE GIRLS GET EQUAL PLEDGE HOW CAN I CALL OUT GENDER DISCRIMINATION WHEN I SEE IT? 1. Speak out about your own experiences It’s important, if you feel comfortable, to call out your own experiences of discrimination. This could be highlighting sexist remarks made by your friends or peers or reporting harassment on public transport. It’s important to note that there are dangers associated with calling others out on their behaviour. People may not like to have their viewpoints challenged; they may react in a negative or aggressive way, so if your instincts tells you that a situation is too risky, your own safety is the priority. Often the best course of action when discrimination is experienced is to alert an authority figure - a member of staff on public transport, or where relevant your teacher or your boss. The more they are made aware these issues are happening, the more they’ll be encouraged to step in and be part of the solution. 2. Call out discrimination in the media and advertising Write to advertisers, marketers and media outlets if you come across stories that portray women and girls in a reductive or unfair way. Are there gender stereotypes in your textbooks at school? Does an advert in your city objectify women? Does a film you’ve watched have fewer speaking roles for women? Find out who is responsible and write to them to let them know your thoughts. Also - vote with your feet. Don’t support entertainment that is disrespectful to girls and women and doesn’t represent their true power, potential, talent and diversity.  Boys in Sri Lanka are gender equality allies  Boys in Sri Lanka are supporting Girls Get Equal as allies. 3. Support other campaigners A great way to make a big effect in the pursuit of gender equality is to join wath others. Seek out local campaign groups. Join or set up school or university societies for gender equality and female leadership. There is strength in numbers - more voices tackling a particular issue means they are more likely to be heard. Helping to raise the profile of campaigns by other marginalised groups is a vital part of ending discrimination. For example, girls from a minority or indigenous community may experience racism as well as sexism, and members of the LGBTIQ+ community may also be experiencing homophobia. Be their allies and lend your voice to their causes. 4. It’s OK to not challenge discrimination every time you see it As mentioned above, sometimes calling out discrimination can carry risks. It’s not your job alone to fix the world. We are all part of the same movement. Just changing how we relate with others, and demanding that others do the same, will not end gender inequality. Lasting change will only happen if the institutions that affect our lives also change. Don’t feel defeated by these big obstacles - each small achievement is an extra step towards our shared goal. Caring for ourselves means we can continue to advocate for gender equality so always make sure you are maintaining your own wellbeing.\",\n",

    "\"Gender discrimination plays out in two sequences. The first one is the immediate disappearance of girls at birth (or during early childhood) while the second one refers to future demographic disturbances among adults. The routine elimination of girls before their birth is no doubt the most extreme symptom of women's contemporary undervaluation that goes well beyond all other forms of discrimination. Since Amartya Sen's pioneer paper on missing women (Sen, 1990), we can measure the extent of the resulting gap across populations. Within families, the imbalance is mostly invisible since parents who abort female fetuses often have had prior girls. But when compared across larger communities, figures point inescapably to a surplus of boys. It is in fact possible to get a better idea of the actual rift between male and female by using demographic estimates on the age and sex distribution for entire populations. ‘Missing women’ are women that ought to be found in population censuses if the sex distribution was not skewed toward men. By applying sex ratios by age computed for nondiscriminating countries, from Latin America to Europe, and correcting for age and mortality variations, it is possible to assess the number of women that are apparently missing from demographic records in Asia and Eastern Europe.\",\n",

    "\"Economic growth is an increase in the production of goods and services over a specific period. To be most accurate, the measurement must remove the effects of inflation. Economic growth creates more profit for businesses. As a result, stock prices rise. That gives companies capital to invest and hire more employees. As more jobs are created, incomes rise. Consumers have more money to buy additional products and services. Purchases drive higher economic growth. For this reason, all countries want positive economic growth. This makes economic growth the most-watched economic indicator.\",\n",

    "\"What happens when we continue “burning the candle at both ends” until we reach physical and emotional exhaustion? Just like the candle itself, we risk burning ourselves out. There is a parable of a frog sitting in a pot on the stove. If dropped into a pot of boiling water, a frog would likely notice and try to escape. But when placed in a pot that is slowly approaching a boil, the frog doesn’t notice until the water has already reached an unbearable heat—at which point it is too hot for the frog to survive. Have you ever experienced a slow acceptance of the pressures around you, until everything is “just too much” and you can barely cope? If so, you’re not alone. About 8.3 million American adults were reported to have experienced serious psychological distress in 2017 (“More Americans suffering from stress, anxiety, and depression, study finds,” 2018). So what if we could notice the boiling signs earlier and even “turn down” the heat? If stress “has become one of the most serious health issues of the 20th century and a worldwide epidemic,” then it is time to start growing the tools of how we handle stress (“Workplace Stress,” 2018).\",\n",

Now, in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak and the most rapid economic downturn since the 2008 financial crisis, many are struggling and one Tokyo-based NPO has been busy fielding calls for help.Counselors at non-profit organization POSSE provide free labor advice in Japanese and English. One of those counselors, Iwahashi Makoto, says they usually get a handful of inquiries each month. But last month the number shot up to 100. Iwahashi Makoto, a counselor at non-profit organization POSSE.Iwahashi says many inquiries came from instructors at foreign language schools in early March. Those schools canceled their classes after Japan’s government called for the closure of elementary, junior high and high schools from March 2. Many instructors were told to stay at home on standby, and they saw their income nosedive. Even if classes took place, instructors complained about a lack of protective measures at their schools, including a failure to press students to wear masks. Later in the month, people in the tourism industry, including receptionists and cleaners at hotels, as well as part-time workers at restaurants and pubs, turned to POSSE for advice. Many of those workers came to Japan from other parts of Asia. Some told counselors their shifts have been cut and their income had dropped sharply. Others said they were facing pressure to quit their jobs as employers cited shrinking sales. For some, the income drop means they can no longer afford to live in Japan.\"\n",
